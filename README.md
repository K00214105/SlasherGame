# SlasherGame
Rationale: 
This virtual reality game provides an interactive immersive VR based experience using Unity3D and HTC Vive to the user. The game is a clone of a game called Beatsaber but features machetes instead of sabres and zombies as the target to slash. The main target audience is English speaking users in the 13+ age group. The blood and fire particle effects are appealing to the user and gives them an immersive feeling in the game. 
I performed an audience analysis of the potential users and did some research. I then created prototypes of the game and began creating the assets for the game.
I used three different pieces of software to create the game, Abobe PhotoShop, Unity 3D and 3DS Max. I used photoshop to create the imagery and backgrounds used in the game. I used unity 3D to create the game and 3DS max to create some assets for the game.
